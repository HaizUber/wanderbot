# 🌍 Wanderbot — Minecraft Discord Companion

**Wanderbot** is a custom-built Discord bot designed for managing and enhancing the experience of players in the *Wanderlust Unbound* Minecraft server. It connects Discord and Minecraft together with features like daily login rewards, live server status, and more — all powered by RCON and Discord’s slash command API.
